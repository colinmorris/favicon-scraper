Some (messy) code for scraping and processing favicons.

The `scraping/` subdir has the scraping code, which uses scrapy and is very basic.

The `postprocessing/` subdir has most of the code I used to sort/filter/dedupe the favicon files once scraped, and to generate a csv with metadata about them.
